After completing this assignment, please reflect on what you learned by answering the following questions. Be thorough and thoughtful in your responses.

---

## 1. Mathematical Understanding

**Question:** Explain in your own words what a Taylor series is and why it is useful for approximating functions like e^x and ln(1+x). Give an example of when this might be useful in real life.

**Your Answer:**

```
TODO
```

## 2. Convergence and Accuracy

**Question:** You noticed that adding more terms to the Taylor series generally makes the approximation more accurate. However, was this always true for all values of x? Describe what you observed when testing different values of x, and explain why some values might be harder to approximate than others.

**Your Answer:**

```
TODO
```

## 3. Debugging Experience

**Question:** Describe the most challenging bug you encountered while fixing the code. What was the error message, what did it mean, and how did you figure out how to fix it? What debugging strategies did you use?

**Your Answer:**

```
TODO
```

## 4. Python vs. Mathematical Notation

**Question:** Compare the mathematical formula for the Taylor series of ln(1+x) with how you implemented it in Python code. What challenges did you face in translating the mathematical notation into code? How did Python's syntax handle the alternating signs?

**Your Answer:**

```
TODO
```

## 5. Computational Efficiency

**Question:** The factorial function grows very quickly (5! = 120, 10! = 3,628,800). What do you think would happen if you tried to calculate e^x using 100 terms? What are some potential problems with using too many terms, and how might programmers solve these issues?

**Your Answer:**

```
TODO
```

---

## 6. Error Analysis

**Question:** Looking at your program's output, you saw different types of errors: absolute error and relative error (percentage). Explain the difference between these two types of errors and discuss which one is more important when x is very small (like 0.01) versus when x is larger (like 2.0).

**Your Answer:**


```
TODO
```

---

## 7. Limitations and Boundaries

**Question:** The Taylor series for ln(1+x) only converges when -1 < x â‰¤ 1. What happened when you tested values outside this range? Why do you think this mathematical limitation exists? How does this relate to the domain of the natural logarithm function?

**Your Answer:**

```
TODO
```

---

## 8. Real-World Applications

**Question:** Research and describe one real-world application where computers need to approximate mathematical functions (like in graphics, physics simulations, financial calculations, etc.). How might the concepts you learned in this assignment apply to that field?

**Your Answer:**

```
TODO
```

## 9. Programming Insights

**Question:** Before this assignment, how did you think functions like math.exp() and math.log() worked? How has your understanding changed? What does this teach you about the relationship between mathematics and computer science?

**Your Answer:**

```
TODO
```

## 10. Extension and Creativity

**Question:** If you were to extend this project, what would you add? Consider other mathematical functions that could be approximated with Taylor series (like sin(x), cos(x), or sqrt(1+x)), or improvements to make the program more user-friendly or educational. Describe your idea and explain why it would be valuable.

**Your Answer:**

```

## Bonus Reflection

**Question:** What was the most surprising thing you learned during this assignment? This could be about mathematics, programming, debugging, or the relationship between the two.

**Your Answer:**

```
TODO
```

## 11. Computational Efficiency and Performance

**Question:** One of the bugs you encountered involved the factorial function becoming very slow for large numbers. Explain why calculating factorials repeatedly is inefficient and describe how you might solve this problem. What did this teach you about the importance of choosing efficient algorithms?

**Your Answer:**

```
TODO
```

---

## 12. Input Validation and Edge Cases

**Question:** Several bugs in the code were related to invalid input values (like negative number of terms, or x values outside the convergence range). Why is input validation important in programming? Give examples of what could go wrong without proper validation, and describe strategies programmers use to handle invalid input.

**Your Answer:**
